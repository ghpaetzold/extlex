When creating a lexical analyzer for a new language, one used to be faced with two choices: to create one from scratch specifically for your language, or trying out a often complex to use scanner/lexer generator.

EXTLex is a Lexical Analyzer in Java that can generate tokens for all languages encoded in ASCII, and also provides a way of personalizing lexical error detection in your code. It offers an alternative for those who would not like to program their own lexical analyzer, yet have issues understanding regular expressions or struggle to use Lexical Analyzer generators.

EXTLex provides a comprehensible manual on how to run the compiled Java application, and also on how to produce the input files necessary for it to run.
