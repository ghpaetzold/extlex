{"name":"EXTLex","tagline":"Lexical analysis for compilers with error detection.","body":"### Introduction\r\nEXTLex is a lexical analyser for compilers. It is developed in Java and provides a framework for error detection during lexical analysis.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nSince EXTLex is a pre-compiled Java project, it requires no installation. Simply make sure you have Java >1.8 installed in your machine, download the project and place it in a folder of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\nTo run EXTLex, you will first need to provide the input files it requires, which are:\r\n\r\n* **Automata File:** File containing the finite automata that describes the language to be analysed.\r\n* **Reserved Words File:** File containing the reserved words of the language to be analysed.\r\n* **Code File:** The file with the code to be analysed.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to create the Automata File and the Reserved Words File, please refer to the \"Creating a language for EXTLex.pdf\" guide included in this project. Once you have produced all required files, simply run the following command line:\r\n\r\n    java -jar EXTLex.jar <automata_file> <reserved_words_file> <code_file>\r\n\r\nThe output will be provided in STDOUT. You can also import EXTLex into your Java project and use its classes and functions to create your own compiler.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nIf you have any problems or questions about the toolkit, simply report it in the issues section of the project's Github page.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
